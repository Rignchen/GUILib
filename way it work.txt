when the block is placed, the entity has to be given (cf syntaxe.json)
then run as this entity the function tag #guilib:call/init

the init function will then sort the nbt you gave

then once the container's items change it will copy your nbt somwere else
then it will check wich slot of first itinerance is the smaller between your input and the items
it's gonna remove the smallest one and restart untill it find one where the slots are the smaller
it will then check the id, ctc, custom check to see if it can stay, if not then it's gonna remove it

if you want to make a custom check then give the nbt Slots.Items.custom a value
once that's done you can run a function from "#guilib:event/custom_test"
in that function test if the score #custom guilib.temp matches yyour value
then you can do your test at the end you should set the score #test guilib.temp to 1 or 0
0 meand it can stay, 1 it needs to go (that's easier for me that way with the code)
